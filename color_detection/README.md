Progress:
Open CV Camera will open and detect red box on screen
Drone will to search for a red box by spinning in a circle and remaining in one location
Camera can detect the color and drone will stop searching, and then go 5ft from the color and remain there indefinietly. 

Goals: 
Have the drone wait for 30 seconds and then start searching for a new color. 
Have the drone figure out distance using 3D camera instead of math 
Stop the search and find from ramming into the floor and destroying the health of the drone
add comments to determine when the drone is hitting the ground and when the object is detected 
figure out how to exit the loop after "shooting" the box
